#GeXxJS Javascript dialect

GeXx.js The New Javascript dialect/language, the idea is to transform any javascript code into **valid** javascript code based of only 8 possible chars:

    Possible_Chars = [ "+", "!", "[", "]", "{", "}", "(", ")" ]

The main idea is that you can get 0 from +[] and 1 from +!+[]
After that you can get string integers just from []+(+!+[]) === "1"
Ok now we have powerfull stuff but we still can't do much, but because ([]+{}) equals to "[object Object]"
then ([]+{})[+!+[]+!+[]] === "b" because it is the second(index) element of that "[object Object]" string

**Awesome!**
We can now get `[ "[", "o", "b", "j", "e", "c", "t", " ", "O", "b", "j", "e", "c", "t", "]" ]`
.
.
.
( After a lot of hacking the way up to the primal Object, we can run **any string as JS code** thus we can do EVERYTHING! )


##Example

If you want to test it out you will need to have node.js on your machine. Then insert javascript code into **./IN.dat** and run **!+([{}]).js** (true.js) :

    $ node "!+([{}]).js"

after that you will get new file in **./build/program.dat** that will contain JS code written in GeXxJS dialect, you can open it and enjoy the futuristic art.

to test it out just run;

    $ node ./build/program.dat

or include it in any html

```
<script type="text/javascript" src="./build/program.dat"></script>
```

##Todo

 - Make node's require() work, so that node modules can be easily transformed.
 - Refactor the code so it is more readable.
 - ~~Solve stack problems with Chrome and Node (v8) when running big GeXxJS files.~~

##Fun facts

 - Currently without optimization, jQuery 1.12.4 is 10.5 MB (11,097,274 bytes).
